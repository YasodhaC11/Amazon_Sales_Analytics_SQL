# Amazon_Sales_Analytics_SQL
This project analyzes sales data for an e-commerce platform (Amazon). Using SQL, I performed various operations such as data cleaning, analysis, and reporting to uncover insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Key Features:
- **Sales Analysis**: Calculated total sales by product line, region, and time period.
- **Customer Behavior Insights**: Identified high-value customers, repeat buyers, and customer retention metrics.
- **Data Aggregation**: Used SQL functions like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `JOIN` to analyze and aggregate data.
- **Advanced SQL**: Demonstrated the use of complex queries involving `JOIN`, `PARTITION BY`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and other window functions.
  
## How to Use:
1. Download the repository
2. Open the `.sql` file(s) in your preferred SQL editor
3. Run the queries to analyze the sales data
