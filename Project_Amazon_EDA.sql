/*
CONCLUSION:Based on the analysis, we can conclude that customer buying behavior varies across 
branches and times of the day. Marketing efforts can be optimized by targeting peak hours and 
promoting high-profit product lines. Enhancing stock levels and staffing during weekends may 
improve customer satisfaction and revenue.*/
